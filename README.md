# reverse-proxy
A reverse proxy application written in Go redirects client requests to a target server and executes them on the target server. It also supports port forwarding, allowing requests to be directed to different target servers based on the port number. The application uses the "net/http" and "net/http/httputil" packages, which facilitate the processing of HTTP requests and the creation of an HTTP server using the HTTP protocol.
